# Kiosk Case

This directory contains basic information about the physical case design for the kiosks used in the UFID Reader project.

## Overview

- The kiosk case is designed to securely house hardware components and provide a user-friendly interface.
- The current case was created by the original project team (Team 1) and is already printed.
- Future teams may update or modify the design as needed.

## Notes

- Team 2 did not work extensively with the case or its files.
- The case should be passed along to future project teams for reference or updates.
